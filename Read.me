## Project 1: Clustering with SOM, Classification with SLFN
- **Task**: 
  - Part I: Use Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for clustering countries based on coronavirus cases.
  - Part II: Implement a Single Layer Feed-forward Network (SLFN) for classification tasks.
- **Model**: 
  - SOM for unsupervised clustering.
  - SLFN for classification.
- **Dataset**: 
  - Coronavirus cases data for clustering.
  - A provided dataset for classification.
  
## Project 2: Recurrent Neural Networks in the World of Stocks
- **Task**: 
  - Use simple RNNs (Elman or Jordan networks) to predict the Tehran Stock Exchange Index based on historical price data.
- **Model**: 
  - Simple RNNs (Elman or Jordan networks).
- **Dataset**: 
  - Four years of historical data for the Tehran Stock Exchange Index.

## Project 3: Blind Source Separation Using Variational Autoencoders
- **Task**: 
  - Part I: Use Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to separate mixed MNIST and Fashion MNIST images.
  - Part II: Use VAEs to separate vocal and background music components from audio recordings.
- **Model**: 
  - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
- **Dataset**: 
  - MNIST and Fashion MNIST for image separation.
  - IRMAS dataset for music separation.

## Project 4: Persian News Classification Using LSTM+Attention
- **Task**: 
  - Implement an LSTM model with an attention mechanism to classify a Persian news dataset into different categories.
- **Model**: 
  - LSTM with attention mechanism.
- **Dataset**: 
  - Persian news dataset containing titles, summaries, and content of news articles across six categories.
